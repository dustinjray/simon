#About

I was following along with Angela Yu's "Complete 2020 Web Development Bootcamp" on Udemy and I saw that one of the upcoming projects was to create a Simon game. Being familiar with the game I decided to stop the course at that point and create it on my own first. This is the result.

In terms of style, it took me a couple of versions to get something that I liked and looked decent across several different device types. It could definitely still be improved, but it doesn't look horrible and the main thing I was testing myself on was getting the logic of the game working correctly, so I'm going to call this one done. 

Please find the playable version of the game at: http://dustinjray.github.io/simon
