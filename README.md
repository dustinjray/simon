[Play the Game](https://dustinjray.github.io/simon)
##Inspiration
I was following along with Angela Yu's [Web Development Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/) and saw that an upcoming project was to create a JavaScript Simon game. Being familiar with the game, I decided to step away from the course to see if I could create it on my own, without explicit direction, first. This is the result.

## About
I think the biggest takeaway from this project, for me, was learning about using async and await to properly delay executions of functions so that the sequence would play at a reasonable speed, and the program wouldn't get ahead of itself.
